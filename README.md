### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am passionate **Lead Software Engineer**, and despite you won't find super cool stuff built in dozens of languages built even while sleeping in this repo, I can proudly say I have been involved in software development since I have memory, which has made me develop good habits and persue software engineering best practices. You will find with me a pragmatic and reliable allied when time to build solutions comes.

I enjoy learning from others and sharing my experiences with colleagues to grow together and domain the context we dive into. As I value collboration, I enjoy story telling as a way to share things I learn, read, and time to time I write reflections about challenges I faced, patterns I observe across different projects and teams I interacted with.


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting beetter at Leadership, Architecture while staying always in touch with â˜•Javaâ˜•
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m looking for opportunities to grow towards Leadership Engineering, complex system designing
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborate on NGO and teaching / coaching projects
- âš¡ Fun fact I've been blogging about travels for more than 10 years

ðŸŽ¯ Iâ€™m experienced working with:

**Java, Spring Boot, Microservice, Kafka, CI/CD, AWS**


âœ¨ I also enjoy:

**Lambda, Serverless Programming, Frontend Technology**


ðŸ’¬ And feel comfortable with:
Software Engineering best practices such as eXtremme Programming
Growing teams and interactions to build great products
Knowledge sharing, story telling and connecting people

Thank you!!!
